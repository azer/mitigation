Build the webserver via:

    # go install github.com/sarnowski/mitigation/example-httpd


No become root and start the "example-httpd":

    # $GOPATH/bin/example-httpd

There are some options to configure the server:

    # $GOPATH/bin/example-httpd -help

A typical test run on debian system would look like this:

    # $GOPATH/bin/example-httpd -htdocs="/var/www" -listen=":81" -user="www-data"

Now verify that it serves the correct directory and switched
its user to "www-data".
